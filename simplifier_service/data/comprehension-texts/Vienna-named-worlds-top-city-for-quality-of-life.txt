Adv: Vienna is the world’s best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life. German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna joined by Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven. Paris has tumbled down the league, falling ten places to 37th, just ahead of London at 39th, almost entirely because of the city’s vulnerability to terrorist attacks. The study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate offices and factories and how much they should pay staff.

German-speaking cities do well in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna, Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven. Paris fell ten places to 37th. This was mostly because of the terrorist attacks on the city. Paris was just above London in 39th place. The study looked at the economy, health, education, housing and the environment.

Adv: Viennese-born Helena Hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her city’s top position. The municipality’s social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making Vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities. “I live in a 100sq-meter turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutes’ walk from the city center. But my rent is just €800 (£625) a month.” An equivalent apartment in London would cost upwards of £2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table.

Int: Helena Hartlauer, 32, from Vienna, said she was not surprised at her city’s top position. The city’s social democratic government has a long tradition of investing money in high-quality social housing, which makes Vienna less expensive than other major cities. “I live in a 100sq-meter apartment in a good area about 20 minutes’ walk from the city center. But my rent is just €800 (£625) a month.” A similar apartment in London would cost over £2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table.

Ele: Helena Hartlauer, 32, is from Vienna. She said she was not surprised about her city’s top position. For many years, Vienna’s government has spent money on good social housing. This makes Vienna a cheap place to live compared to other big cities. “I live in a 100 square-meter apartment in a good area about 20 minutes’ walk from the city center. But my rent is just €800 (£625) a month.” A similar apartment in London costs over £2,000 and even more in New York, which came 44th in the study.

Adv: US cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. The highest ranking city in the US is San Francisco, at 28th; Boston is 34th. Canadian cities, led by Vancouver, far outrank their US rivals in the table. “You don’t realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad,” said Hartlauer. “We also have terrific public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs €1 per trip.”

Adv: “Our big USP (unique selling point) is our geographical location,” said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassador to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years. “The fall of the Berlin Wall helped define Vienna as a hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.” According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest figures for GDP per head in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although quite some way below neighboring Switzerland. Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the world’s second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun. “There are more students in Vienna than any other German-speaking city,” said Hartlauer. “It’s a very fast growing, young and lively city,” she added – though she conceded she works for the city’s tourist board.
