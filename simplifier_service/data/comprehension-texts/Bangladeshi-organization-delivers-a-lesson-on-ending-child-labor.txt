Adv: The small space is set up to look like a classroom. Its corrugated iron walls are hung with educational charts – illustrated letters of the alphabet and a map of Bangladesh. But, the constant sound of hammering and the chemicals in the air that catch in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes make it hard to concentrate. The children who learn in this three-square-meter room are the lucky ones, however. They have escaped working in the factories opposite.

But, it is hard to concentrate – there is the loud hammering and chemicals in the air that hurt the throat and eyes. But, the children who learn in this three-square-meter room are lucky.

Adv: For 14 years, SOHAY, a grassroots non-governmental organization (NGO) funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief, has been working in slum areas of Dhaka to get child laborers into school. It focuses on children working in hazardous conditions – in aluminum and plastic factories, and tanneries. The classroom is one of 23 urban development centers that SOHAY has set up across the capital. The centers prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. Once they are in primary school, the children can do homework at the centers, with help from their peers. Alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centers. His father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. They are all happy that he’s now in school and away from hazardous work. His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “I like school,” he says.

Ele: For 14 years, SOHAY, a non-governmental organization (NGO), has worked in slums in Dhaka to send child workers to school. It especially tries to help children who do dangerous work. The classroom is one of 23 centers that SOHAY has set up in Dhaka. The classes at the centers help children enter primary school. When they are in school, the children get extra help with their homework at the centers. Alamin, ten years old, used to work in a plastic factory. He now goes to one of the centers. His parents are happy that he’s now in school and not doing dangerous work. His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “I like school,” he says.

Adv: SOHAY also runs sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labor and offers skills training to increase family income. “Getting working children into formal education is really very challenging,” says SOHAY’s program manager, Mohammed al-Mamun. “Their psychological and physical condition is not like other children in society. After they leave work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school.” It is also very challenging to ensure they stay in school – the dropout rate is very high for these children. Seven-year-old Zhorna Akter Sumayya has two older brothers, both of whom are in work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). But, after being introduced to education at one of SOHAY’s centers, she now goes to a state primary school. Her parents can’t survive without the income their sons bring home, but they were keen for their daughter to go to school.

Adv: In 2015, SOHAY helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 vulnerable children – those in danger of entering work – into school. About 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017. The organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights under Bangladesh’s 2010 child labor elimination code of conduct. The policy aimed to eradicate all forms of child labor by 2015 but that target was missed. The Labor Law of Bangladesh 2006 bans children under the age of 14 from working but, according to the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under that age are employed in the informal sector and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries.
